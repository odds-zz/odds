            <h1>ODDS About</h1>
            <span class="span12">
                ODDS is a non-profit charity that
spends 100% of  donations to provide basic necessities such as food, clothing, shelter and vocational training to  orphans and 
homeless children living in Tanzania. The project started as our contribution to orphanhood across the country. 
We therefore take this work as personal and charitable in every way. Every penny of your contribution
goes directly to  the orphanage you support. All orphanages and shelters that receive
our help are registered non-profit organizations  and have at least a 5-year record of accomplishment.
