            <h4>Who are so-called "street children"? </h4><br>

<p>International civil society has a vocabulary used to describe and define the situation of children who reside in the streets, and there are various definitions used to classify them.<br>
For instance, UNICEF delineates the following:<br>

    Full-time: A child who lives, sleeps, works and eats on the streets without adult supervision and care - a child "OF the street".<br>
    Part-time: A child who comes to the street environment for part of the day, often to beg or to work as a vendor, and then returns home at night - a child "ON the street".<br>
    "At risk" / vulnerable child: A child who lives in poverty or is a victim of family breakdown and thus is at risk of migrating to the street (full or part-time).</p>
