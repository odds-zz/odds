                                                        The Government has one Orphanage in the country, situated at 
                                                        Kurasini. The government strategy is to minimize sources of orphanhood 
                                                        as much as possible.
                                                        Thus, it remains to be held that our current efforts in someways can accelerate 
                                                        the problem of orphans and urban migration of youth to orphan centers where they
                                                        will want to be taken care of. This is an important insight that has led to our shift 
                                                        of focus from orphanages to addressing particular orphans in our communities who can 
                                                        be identified from their respective wards and municipalities. This in turn means orphans 
                                                        will be reached directly by our program. To be a part of development, please contact us.
